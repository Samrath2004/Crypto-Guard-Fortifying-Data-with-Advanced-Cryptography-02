# Crypto-Guard-Fortifying-Data-with-Advanced-Cryptography-02
Our cryptography project develops a user-friendly system for secure encryption and decryption. It employs advanced algorithms and intuitive interfaces, catering to diverse user needs while ensuring robust data protection.
Project Name: CryptoGuard

Description:
CryptoGuard is an innovative cryptography project aimed at enhancing data security and privacy through advanced encryption techniques. It provides users with a secure platform for encrypting and decrypting sensitive files, ensuring confidentiality and integrity in digital communications.

Key Features:

Robust Encryption: CryptoGuard employs advanced cryptographic algorithms to encrypt files securely, protecting them from unauthorized access.
Secure Key Management: Users can generate, store, and manage encryption keys securely, ensuring only authorized individuals can access encrypted files.
User-Friendly Interface: CryptoGuard features an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to encrypt, decrypt, and manage their files with minimal effort.
Data Integrity Verification: The project includes hashing algorithms to verify the integrity of encrypted files, ensuring they have not been tampered with during transmission or storage.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: CryptoGuard is designed to work seamlessly across different operating systems, providing flexibility and convenience for users.
Installation:

Clone the CryptoGuard repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Run the application using npm start.
Usage:

Launch the CryptoGuard application.
